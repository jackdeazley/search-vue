This was my first run at Vue and I found it great! I found a lot of similarities between it and Angular which helped throughout the challenge. I also found declaring templates and props to be quite similar to how React works which also helped. 

I wanted to create the store through a factory pattern so it was fairly reusable, which is why I have implemented the store like so. In terms of unit testing, I come from a TDD background so Ive included some tests to do with generating the store, usually I would make sure all functions and components etc are thoroughly tested, but since I am new to vue and also with time restrictions, I kept it limited
